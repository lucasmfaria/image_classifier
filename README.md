# Image Classifier

> Convolutional Neural Network for image classification (binary or multiclass). Uses transfer learning with pre-trained
> VGG16 model. Tested with python 3.9.

## ðŸ’» Prerequisites

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## â˜• Using the code

```
- Use "create_splits.py" to create the train, test and validation splits.
- Use "train.py" to train your neural network
- Use "test.py" to evaluate your model
```

### TODOs

- [ ] Create script to delete last model trained and its logs
- [ ] Create user interface to train and test
- [ ] Create API for model serving/deploy
